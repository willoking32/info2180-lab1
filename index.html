 <h2>William Whitelocke</h2>
<p>My original inspriration for persuing a career in computer science was a facination with the creation <br>
of exploits for video games. Later I gained a curiosity for the creation of video games themselves. <br>
However, the intrest in web development seemed to appear on its own. As if it was part of the journey <br>
to distant goals. I do intend to see this through to the best of my abilities.</p>
